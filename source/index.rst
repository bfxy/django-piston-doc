Welcome to Django Piston documentation!
#######################################

Piston is a Django-based mini-framework for creating RESTful APIs.

.. contents:: :local:
   :depth: 2

What Piston does
================

* Provides a simple and direct way to access databases (models) via URL
* Includes authentication support (OAuth, Basic/Digest)
* Allows to create custom emitters that respond to requests via JSON/XML/YAML/Pickle
* Supports streaming and throttling
* Makes extensive use of HTTP status codes (including PUT and DELETE)

Getting started
===============

Download the `latest version <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-piston/0.2.3>`_.

Workflow
========

The workflow is simple and twofold:

1. Create a handler
2. Bind a handler to a URL

Example
=======

.. _example:

Suppose, we need to access a blog entry in our database. Like any other Django project, the blog contains database description in *models.py*, handlers requesting resources from the database in *handlers.py*, and URLs mapped to handlers in *urls.py*.

The **entry** resides in the ``Entry`` model, and has ``text`` field and ``slug`` field, all defined in *models.py*:

.. code-block:: python

   class Entry(models.Model):
       text = models.TextField()
       slug = models.SlugField(max_length=128, unique=True)

*handlers.py* defines handlers that allow certain HTTP requests towards the ``Entry`` model:

.. literalinclude:: handlers.py
   :language: python

Piston maps HTTP requests directly to the method in the handler. In the example, the handler allows ``GET`` request uniquely and maps it directly to ``read`` method. Similarly, ``PUT`` request is mapped to ``update`` method, ``POST`` is mapped to ``create`` method, and ``DELETE`` is mapped to ``delete`` method.

*urls.py* maps the handler to the URL pattern for the request:

.. code-block:: python

   entry_resource = Resource(handler=EntryHandler)

   urlpatterns += patterns('',
       url(r'entries/(?P<slug>[\w-_]+)/', entry_resource, name='entry_url'))

This will allow the client to retrieve a blog entry in JSON format over the request: ``GET /entry/<slug>/``.

Request
=======

The code in the :ref:`example <example>` allows a client to retrieve the **entry** over a neat request:

* ``GET`` ``/entry/<slug>/``

To define the output format, add the ``format`` parameter to the query string:

.. _request:

* ``GET`` ``/entry/<slug>/?format=YAML``

Response
========

The handler does not return an HTTP response, but returns the **entry** itself. Piston responds using emitters. The default emitter uses JSON, however Piston also supports YAML, XML, and Pickle. You can define the format in the :ref:`query string<request>`.

You can use Pison with not just models, but with any data you wish to retrieve via API, as long as the data is serializable.


Status codes
============

Piston allows handlers to respond with HTTP status codes in certain situations.

Say, we have to call a ``create`` method to add an item to the database. If the item already exists, the method below will return ``rc.DUPLICATE_ENTRY``, which stands for ``409 Conflict/Duplicate``. If the item does not exist, the method will create the item:

.. code-block:: python

   def create(self, request):
       if self.exists(**request.POST):
           return rc.DUPLICATE_ENTRY
       else:
           return Entry.objects.create(**request.POST)

Similarly, the successfully called ``delete`` method will return ``rc.DELETED``, which stands for ``204 Empty body``:

.. code-block:: python

   def delete(self, request, slug):
       entry = get_object_or_404(Entry, slug=slug)
       entry.delete
       return rc.DELETED
